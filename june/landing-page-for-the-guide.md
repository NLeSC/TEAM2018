# Description

[The guide](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/) is an important point of contact between us and the outside world. People are starting to look at it more and more, and it is likely to continue to grow in 
importance. As such, it would be useful to spend some effort making sure the guide is up-to-date, and visible the outside world. 

One idea is to take "research-software.nl" and turn it into a landing page for information on research software development and application. External institutes are also interested to 
participate in this. DANS will join the sprint to think about the software publication and archiving parts. 

# Goals

In this sprint we will work on:

 - Look at the guide with critical eyes:
 - Decide what content we would like to share and how
 - Work out some of parts in more detail, such as a software deposit route we're developing in collaboration with DANS
 - Wireframing an attractive landing page for https://research-software.nl 
 - Have a written rationale and workplan for the near future
