# Description

In this sprint, we want to kick-start the new-style Orchestration and Workflow
SIG, which will probably also include Containers. In order to do this we
want to do some literature research, to get an overview of the current state of
affairs in this field. Stijn has some nice tooling for this, and he can help us
get started with cool graphs and tables.

Furthermore, we have an incomplete overview of workflow-related systems that
have been and are being developed at NLeSC, that we would like to complete. That
should give us an idea of what we need in this field.

Finally, there should be a chapter in the Guide, with basic information on
workflows and how to get started, as well as how to contact the SIG for help.

# Goals

* Guide chapter about Containers, Orchestration and Workflows
* Overview of relevant current workflow systems and what they can do
* Overview of what we have done and are doing in this area
