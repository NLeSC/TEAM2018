# Description

The new interaction provenance tracking library for web applications that we've defined and built in Linz together with the Johannes Kepler University 
is but the first step to modularization and reimplementation of all of the functionality of the CLUE application. While we are at speed already,
it would be good to have a quick continuation of the project so we can restore the existing functionality and bring it to a much larger audience.
In this sprint I'd like to work on the presentation module.

# Goals

First of all we'll do some requirements engineering for the visual storytelling module to work with the new provenance library.
Then it's on to API design and implementation for interoperability between this module and the provenance graph visualization module.
After this we'll define JEST tests for API functions for test-driven development, in conjunction with implementing the API functions themselves.
Finally, if there's time left we'll make an example that shows off the functionality.
