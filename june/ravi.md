# Description

As the center grows, the planning of _who works on which projects how much_ becomes increasingly complicated.
Not only do we get more engineers and more projects, we also allow PI's now to unevenly distribute the
"burning of hours" during the project.
For about one year now we make the planning with an inhouse tool called _Ravi_, which is a big improvement over
excel. However, as we aim for more flexibility in how engineers contribute to projects,
further work is needed, for example to enable multiple users (all coordinators or even all engineers) to access the planning.

# Goals

- Define current issues/shortcomings/wishes concerning the planning (i.e. requirements).
- The opinion that we shouldn't develop a planning tool inhouse keeps popping up (and rightly so). We will select 2-4 most promising existing tools and perform a trial with them.
- Based on the trial and requirements list we'll make a go-nogo decicion on inhouse development of Ravi.
- If we go for Ravi, the remainder of the sprint involves implementing the remaining requirements (step 1), e.g.
  - Enabling multiple users to modify the planning.
  - A flexible "booking" mechanism to provide engineers with more control of their own activities.
- If we go for an external tool, the remainder of the sprint involves (making a start with) migrating the current planning to the new tool..
