# 3De-e-Chem demo

For the project http://3d-e-chem.github.io/ multiple KNIME workflows and nodes where written. They are described in 2 papers: http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.6b00686 and http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cmdc.201700754.

A Vagrant virtual machine (https://3d-e-chem.github.io/3D-e-Chem-VM/) has been made with KNIME, the workflows and nodes installed in it.

For the eScience symposium 2017 we made a couple of [screencasts](https://nlesc.sharepoint.com/sites/all/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2Fall%2FShared%20Documents%2FProjectportfolio%2FProjects%2F27014201%203D-e-chem%2FD-%20Products%2F3D-e-Chem-NLeSC-Symposium-2017-screencasts%2Ezip&parent=%2Fsites%2Fall%2FShared%20Documents%2FProjectportfolio%2FProjects%2F27014201%203D-e-chem%2FD-%20Products).
For a demo I would like use the screencasts and make a storyboard for that will lead the presenter through the virtual machine, opening and running several workflows.
