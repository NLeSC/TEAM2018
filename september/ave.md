# Allelic Variant Explorer demo

The Allelic Variation Explorer (AVE) is a web application to visualize (clustered) single-nucleotide variants across genomes.

There is a Docker image with the application and a sample dataset at https://github.com/nlesc-ave/ave-demo 

This Docker images is for showing the application works, to create a proper demo a scientific storyboard has to be written.

The story I have in mind is to take a gene which encodes for some visual charactistic (color, shape, stem size etc.) of a tomato and show that different tomatos strains have different visuals.
Showe the visual difference as pictures combined with the clustering of the genomes in the explorer.

This would require some literature searches and if the gene is not included in the sample dataset, a new dataset must be constructed.
