# Sprint Name 
ReGIS

# Team leader
Berend / Carlos

# Target project 
GeoVis

# Expertise required
Typescript, Angular, Leaflet

# Size of team
4 or 5

# Description
Several projects at the eScience center have a Geo component. During previous sprints we started laying down the foundations of ReGIS. Since then very little progress has been made on developing this further -- but the need for ReGIS remains. 

What is ReGIS needed for? ReGIS is needed for managing geo-related data (data sets with a geographical component), running computations using these data and visualizing results from these computation (possibly also having a geo-component).

# Goals
 - Develop UI components for ReGIS Leaflet connector (to be further detailed as github issues in advance of the sprint)
 - Develop UI components for ReGIS Cesium connector
 - Extending ReGIS to interoperate with existing solutions such as [Terria](http://terria.io/)
 - Further develop the ReGIS backend to support new functionality required for other usecases.
