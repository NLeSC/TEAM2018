# Description

[SPOT](https://github.com/nlesc/spot) is a generic svisual data analytics tool for multi-dimensional
datasets. Although, it was primarily developed for High Energy Physics project [IDARK](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/project/idark), it is a generic software that can be used in some other domains where the dataset is complex.

Currently, we have a demo using famous Titanic dataset (see http://spot.esciencecenter.nl).

# Goals
- The main goal will be to focus on finding a nice (scientific) use case and an interesting datasets for a demo
- The demo will be used in external presentations and SPOT workshops which we are planning to organize when the materials are ready
- Update the demo web site
- Dockerize the demo
- Identify missing feautures to be used in certain domains
