# Description

Next to the eWaterCycle II flagship project, a small EOSCPilot demonstrator project has also been granted. The goal of this project is to implement a FAIR version of eWaterCycle I (see forecast.ewatercycle.org), from both a data and a software perspective.

We will use this sprint to make some progress in this project, starting with FAIR data availability using the OneData platform, and (if time) do some work on the software side as well using containers and BMI.

# Goals

- Working OneData on Cartesius and/or HPCCloud.
- FAIR eWaterCycle I output archive in OneData.
- Notebook running analysis of eWaterCycle I data from OneData archive.
- Knowledge on how to share non-open-data with OneData.
