# TEAM2018
This is the repo for the 2018 TEAM sprint

This years topic will be: 

__our projects__

... for the broadest definition of 'projects'. This includes our regular projects, eStep, Flagship, RSD, EU projects, etc.

Due to the fast growth of the eScience Center over the last year, it is no longer practical to jointly work on a single project in the team sprint. That's why we have decided to broaden the scope and go for several projects instead. We'll still schedule everything together in a sprint week (with standups, presentations, etc.) to keep the team building aspect. It's important to get to know your colleagues, especially since we are growing so fast. 

__Do you have an idea for a sprint?__

Do you need the expertise of others for a week ? Is your project not moving fast enough ? Do you need to adapt an existing tool to a new project? This is your opportunity to submit an idea for a sprint! 

If you have an idea, please add it to the ideas folder here:

https://github.com/NLeSC/TEAM2018/tree/master/ideas

There is a `template.md` you can start from. 

Sprints ideas can be on any of the projects we do, provided they: 

   - have a well defined goal. 
   - clearly state what expertise is needed
   - contain enough work for 3-5 people for 4 days.
   - specify which project they relate to (can also be eStep, Flagship, EU etc).

__Dates__

The sprint dates for this year are:
 
- 25-28 June
- 24-27 September
- 26-29 November

__What hours are we writing this on?__

The most often asked question during team sprints is _on which project do I write the hours_? For this year the rules are pretty clear: the hours go to the project that is the topic of your sprint (of course there will always be exceptions, such as multi project sprints, eStep sprints, etc.)  

This does mean that it is good to involve your coordinator (and maybe the PI) when you write a sprint proposal.   

Since we expect the sprints to have well defined goals, you are basically doing a month of work in four days time, and with added expertise you may not have yourself. So it should be pretty easy to convince everyone of the benefits ;-)
